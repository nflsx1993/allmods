AllMods is an open source game mods search engine with automatic scanning, recognition of your queries, tags, and instant search.

AllMods defines a new way to implement mods search for games.

Perform a search on large sites for hosting mods, such as Steam Workshop, Nexusmods, etc. (The search for workshop is performed separately for each game)
Mark your mods for the future so that you don't lose them in the future.
Uses automatic game search on your computer to integrate mods into your games.

Currently implemented:
- Search for mods.
- Automatic search for games on your computer.
- Automatic installation of mods for 37 games. (cs, valheim, RDR2, gta 4-5 ...)
- automatic removal of mods for 37 games (CS, valheim, rdr2, gta 4-5 ...) if you do not like the mod.
- The rest of the games that do not support automatic installation, downloads to the Downloads folder.
- Tagging system with a quick jump to the mod you marked.
- Reminder to update the mod if it was updated by the author.

A lot will be added in the next update.
